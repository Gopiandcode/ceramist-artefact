# Ceramist Artefact

This is the artefact accompanying the CAV 2020 paper entitled
"Ceramist: Certifying Certainty and Uncertainty in Approximate Membership Query Structures".

The artefact contains a scripts that will download and compile the
Ceramist proof scripts in a docker container.

## Prerequisites

In order to build the image, you must have the
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) platform (>= Docker version 19.03.7)
installed and the docker daemon running.

Note: If running on Windows or Mac OS ensure that you have at least 8GB
of RAM allocated to the docker process (see
[here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced) for Mac OS and
[here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced) for Windows).

The source of this artefact script can be obtained from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/Gopiandcode/ceramist-artefact.git
```

## Building the artefact
Note: The artefact is expected to take around 1 hour to compile from
sources.

Once you have the Docker daemon running, navigate to the root of this repository and run:
```
docker build --memory=8g -t ceramist:1.0.1 .
```

Note: If the build fails with a `killed` message, this means that your
docker process ran out of memory - please ensure that you have allowed
it at least 8GB of ram (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced) for
Mac OS and [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced) for
Windows).


This will download all the project's dependencies and will compile the
proof scripts - this will take a while (around 1 hour).

When the build completes, you should see the following output:
```
COQC Structures/CountingBloomFilter/CountingBloomFilter_Probability.v
COQC Structures/QuotientFilter/QuotientFilter_Definitions.v
COQC Structures/QuotientFilter/QuotientFilter_Probability.v
COQC Structures/BlockedAMQ/BlockedAMQ.v
make[1]: Leaving directory '/ceramist'
```

At this point all the proofs in the artefact have been compiled and the docker image is ready.

To browse the files within the image, first start a docker container from the image:
```
docker run --name ceramist --rm -it ceramist:1.01
```
You should now be dropped into a shell with the working directory set to a folder containing the ceramist source code.
From here you can explore the source code/build the coqdoc documentation (using `eval $(opam env) && make doc`, and the output will be placed into a html folder at the ceramist root).

If you wish to browse the files on your local machine, start up the
docker container, using the command above, and *while it is still
running (i.e don't close it)*, in a separate shell, execute:

```
docker cp  ceramist:/ceramist ./ceramist
```

This will copy the compiled ceramist source code (and html
documentation, if you have made it, to your local machine).

```

The library is split into separate logical components by directory:
- *Computation* - defines a probability monad and associated notation for it on top of the 'coq-infotheo' probability library.
- *Utils* - collection of utility lemmas and tactics used throughout the development
- *Structures/Core* - contains definitions and properties about the core probabilistic primitives exported by the library, and defines the abstract AMQ interface satisfied by all instantiations.
- *Structures/BloomFilter* - example use of the exported library to prove various probabilistic properties on bloom filters.
- *Structures/CountingBloomFilter* - another exemplar use of the library to prove probabilistic properties on counting bloom filters. 
- *Structures/QuotientBloomFilter* - exemplar use of library to prove probabilistic properties of quotient filters
- *Structures/BlockedAMQ* - exemplar use of library to prove probabilistic properties of a higher order AMQ - the blockedAMQ 

Check out `Structures/Demo.v` for an example instantiation of the BlockedAMQ to derive Blocked Bloom filters, Counting Blocked bloom filters and Blocked Quotient filters.

## Building Locally
If you wish to step through the proof interactively, we recommend you
build the artefact locally.

To do this, ensure that you have the latest version of
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) installed, and that it has been
correctly initialised (running `opam init` and `eval $(opam env)`).

1. Add the coq-released repository.
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
```

2. Install the dependencies for ceramist (you may also be prompted to use `--unlock-base`):
```
opam install -y --deps-only coq-ceramist.1.0.1
```

3. Clone the ceramist project:
```
git clone https://github.com/certichain/ceramist
cd ./ceramist
```

4. Build ceramist:
```
make
```

5. (Optional) Build ocamldoc - the documentation will be placed into a  folder named `html` at the project root:
```
make doc
```

6. Open the coq source files (`.v` extension) in either coq-ide or
   proof general.
